    - Here the unifying concept will be the notion of duality. Duality will be
            introduced in Chapter 4, and the main theorem of that chapter, the Duality Theorem,
            will provide the answer to the principal question of our study of games, that is, the
            question of existence of a solution.

    -https://ieeexplore-ieee-org.proxy.lib.pdx.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=850652
This paper introduces a coevolutionary method developed for solving constrained optimization problems.
This algorithm is based on the evolution of two populations with opposite objectives to solve saddle-point problems.
